&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man:  (10:13) -KJV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.  (10:14) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he says: “‘By the strength of my hand I have done this, and by my wisdom, because I have understanding. I removed the boundaries of nations, I plundered their treasures; like a mighty one I subdued (Or I subdued the mighty) their kings. (10:13) -NIV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the axe boast itself over him who hews with it? Will the saw make itself greater than him that uses it? As if a rod is able to lift the man who lifted it, or a staff lifts that which is not wood. (10:15) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no wood.  (10:15) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one reaches into a nest, so my hand reached for the wealth of the nations; as men gather abandoned eggs, so I gathered all the countries; not one flapped a wing, or opened its mouth to chirp.’” (10:14) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall an axe exalt itself above the one who hews with it, or a saw vaunt itself over him who handles it? As though the rod wielded him who lifts it up! As though the staff held up the one who is not made of wood! (10:15) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean. (28:8) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these also stagger from wine and reel from beer: Priests and prophets stagger from beer and are befuddled with wine; they reel from beer, they stagger when seeing visions, they stumble when rendering decisions. (28:7) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all tables are filled with vomit; no spot is without excrement. (28:8) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom will he teach knowledge? Whom will he cause to understand the message? Those who are weaned from milk; those who are taken from breasts. (28:9) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts. (28:9) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the tables are covered with vomit and there is not a spot without filth. (28:8) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom shall he give instruction? Whom shall he enlighten with revelation? Weanlings weaned from milk, those just taken from the breast? (28:9) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it is by precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little. (28:10) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little: (28:10) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Who is it he is trying to teach? To whom is he explaining his message? To children weaned from their milk, to those just taken from the breast? (28:9) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it is but precept upon precept, precept upon precept, measure by measure, measure by measure; a trifle here, a trifle there. (28:10) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For with stammering lips, and with another tongue he will speak to this people, (28:11) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people. (28:11) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it is: Do and do, do and do, rule on rule, rule on rule (Hebrew / sav lasav sav lasav / kav lakav kav lakav (possibly meaningless sounds; perhaps a mimicking of the prophet’s words) ; a little here, a little there.” (28:10) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, by incomprehensible speech and a strange tongue must he speak to these people, (28:11) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to those whom he has said, This is the rest—give rest to the weary, and this is the place of repose, but they would not hear. (28:12) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear. (28:12) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very well then, with foreign lips and strange tongues God will speak to this people, (28:11) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to whom he said, This is rest; let the weary rest! This is a respite! But they would not listen. (28:12) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To them the word of LORD is precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little, that they may go but fall backward, and be broken and snared and taken. (28:13) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the word of the Lord was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken. (28:13) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to whom he said, “This is the resting place, let the weary rest”; and, “This is the place of repose”— but they would not listen. (28:12) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to them the word of Jehovah remained: Precept upon precept, precept upon precept, measure by measure, measure by measure; a trifle here, a trifle there, that, persisting, they might lapse into stumbling and break themselves, become ensnared and be taken captive. (28:13) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, hear the word of the LORD, you scoffers, who rule this people who are in Jerusalem. (28:14) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore hear the word of the Lord, ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem. (28:14) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So then, the word of the LORD to them will become: Do and do, do and do, rule on rule, rule on rule (Hebrew / sav lasav sav lasav / kav lakav kav lakav (possibly meaningless sounds; perhaps a mimicking of the prophet’s words); a little here, a little there— so that they will go and fall backward, be injured and snared and captured. (28:13) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore hear the word of Jehovah, you scoffers who preside over these people in Jerusalem. (28:14) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you have said, We have made a covenant with death, and we have an agreement with Sheol. When an overflowing scourge passes through, it will not come to us, for we have made lies our refuge and we have taken shelter in falsehood. (28:15) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves: (28:15) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem. (28:14) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have supposed, by taking refuge in deception and hiding behind falsehoods, to have covenanted with death, or reached an understanding with Sheol, that, should a flooding scourge sweep through the earth, it shall not reach you. (28:15) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, thus the LORD says, Behold I am laying a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone. a sure foundation. He who believes will not be in haste. (28:16) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste. (28:16) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You boast, “We have entered into a covenant with death, with the grave (Hebrew Sheol) we have made an agreement. When an overwhelming scourge sweeps by, it cannot touch us, for we have made a lie our refuge and falsehood (Or false gods) our hiding place.” (28:15) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, thus says my Lord Jehovah: I lay in Zion a stone, a keystone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation. They who believe it will not do rashly. (28:16) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plumb line. And hail will sweep away a refuge of lies, and waters will flood the hiding place. (28:17) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place. (28:17) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is what the Sovereign LORD says: “See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation; the one who trusts will never be dismayed. (28:16) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will make justice the measure, righteousness the weight; a hail shall sweep away your false refuge and waters flood the hiding place. (28:17) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then your covenant with death will be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol will not stand, when the overwhelming scourge passes through, then you will be beaten down. (28:18) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it. (28:18) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line; hail will sweep away your refuge, the lie, and water will overflow your hiding place. (28:17) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your covenant with death shall prove void (Hebrew kuppar, expiated, emended to hupar.), your understanding with Sheol have no effect: when the flooding scourge sweeps through, you shall be overrun by it. (28:18) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As often as it passes through it will take you, because morning after morning, by day and by night it will pass through, and it will be sheer terror to understand the message. (28:19) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report. (28:19) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your covenant with death will be annulled; your agreement with the grave (Hebrew Sheol) will not stand. When the overwhelming scourge sweeps by, you will be beaten down by it. (28:18) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As often as it sweeps through, you shall be seized by it: morning after morning it shall sweep through, by day and by night it shall seize you; it shall cause terror merely to hear word of it. (28:19) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the bed is too short for one to stretch oneself on it, and the blanket too narrow to wrap oneself in it. (28:20) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it. (28:20) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As often as it comes it will carry you away; morning after morning, by day and by night, it will sweep through.” The understanding of this message will bring sheer terror. (28:19) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then shall come to pass the proverb: The couch is too short to stretch out on, the covering too narrow to wrap oneself in. (28:20) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the LORD will rise up as he did on Mount Perazim, he will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon, to do his deed, his strange deed, and to perform his act, his strange act. (28:21) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Lord shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act. (28:21) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bed is too short to stretch out on, the blanket too narrow to wrap around you. (28:20) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Jehovah will rise up as he did on Mount Perazim, and be stirred to anger, as in the Valley of Gibeon— to perform his act, his unwonted act, and do his work, his bizarre work. (28:21) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, do not scoff, lest your bonds be made strong, because I have heard of destruction from the [LORD] of Hostsand it has been irrevocably decided upon the whole earth. (28:22) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord God of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth. (28:22) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LORD will rise up as he did at Mount Perazim, he will rouse himself as in the Valley of Gibeon— to do his work, his strange work, and perform his task, his alien task. (28:21) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now therefore scoff not, lest your bonds grow severe, for I have heard utter destruction decreed by my Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, upon the whole earth. (28:22) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give ear, and hear my voice; Hearken; and hear my speech. (28:23) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech. (28:23) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now stop your mocking, or your chains will become heavier; the Lord, the LORD Almighty, has told me of the destruction decreed against the whole land. (28:22) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give heed, and hear my voice! Be attentive, and listen to what I say! (28:23) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the plowman plow all day, breaking up and harrowing his ground for sowing? (28:24) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his ground? (28:24) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen and hear my voice; pay attention and hear what I say. (28:23) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the plowman be forever plowing to sow seed, disking and harrowing the same ground? (28:24) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once he has leveled its surface, does he not scatter dill, and cast cumin? And he puts wheat in rows, and barley in its proper place, and spelt around the border? (28:25) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their place? (28:25) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a farmer plows for planting, does he plow continually? Does he keep on breaking up and harrowing the soil? (28:24) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he has smoothed its surface, does he not sprinkle fennel and scatter cumin? Does he not demarcate wheat from barley and plant buckwheat in its own plot? (28:25) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his God teaches him judgment, he instructs him. (28:26) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him. (28:26) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he has leveled the surface, does he not sow caraway and scatter cummin? Does he not plant wheat in its place, (The meaning of the Hebrew for this word is uncertain.) barley in its plot, c and spelt in its field? (28:25) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His God instructs him, directing him in the proper procedure. (28:26) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge, nor is a cart wheel rolled over cumin, but dill is beaten out with a staff, and cumin with a rod. (28:27) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod. (28:27) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His God instructs him and teaches him the right way. (28:26) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fennel is not threshed with a sharp-toothed sledge, nor is a cartwheel rolled over cumin: fennel is beaten out with a stick and cumin with a rod. (28:27) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one is indeed threshing wheat, one does not take time to grind it for bread; though the wheel of his cart and horses scatter it, he does not grind it. (28:28) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his horsemen. (28:28) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caraway is not threshed with a sledge, nor is a cartwheel rolled over cummin; caraway is beaten out with a rod, and cummin with a stick. (28:27) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic grain is ground; one does not go on endlessly threshing it. It cannot be ground by driving horse and threshing cart over it.  (28:28) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also comes forth from the LORD of Hosts, he is wonderful in counsel and excellent in wisdom. (28:29) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also cometh forth from the Lord of hosts, which is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working. (28:29) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grain must be ground to make bread; so one does not go on threshing it forever. Though he drives the wheels of his threshing cart over it, his horses do not grind it. (28:28) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things originate with Jehovah of Hosts, whose counsel is wonderful, whose inspiration is surpassing. (28:29) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**</a>Alas Ariel, Ariel, city where David encamped. Add year to year, let pilgrim-feasts run their round. (29:1) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye year to year; let them kill sacrifices. (29:1) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this also comes from the LORD Almighty, wonderful in counsel and magnificent in wisdom. (28:29) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe to Ariel— Ariel, the city where David lodged! Though you add year to year, and the feast days recur in succession, (29:1) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I will distress Ariel, and there will be heaviness and sorrow; for thus has the Lord said unto me, It will be unto Ariel; (29:2) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow: and it shall be unto me as Ariel. (29:2) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe to you, Ariel, Ariel, the city where David settled! Add year to year and let your cycle of festivals go on. (29:1) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet will I distress Ariel: there shall be mourning and sorrow when she becomes as my altar hearth (Or, Ariel, a wordplay.). (29:2) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I the Lord will camp against her round about, and will lay siege against her with a mount, and I will raise forts against her. (29:3) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee. (29:3) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I will besiege Ariel; she will mourn and lament, she will be to me like an altar hearth. d (29:2) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will encamp against you round about, and beleaguer you with assault posts, and erect siege installations against you. (29:3) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she will be brought down, and will speak out of the ground, and her speech will be low out of the dust; and her voice will be as of one that has a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and her speech will whisper out of the dust. (29:4) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust. (29:4) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will encamp against you all around; I will encircle you with towers and set up my siege works against you. (29:3) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when you have been laid low, you will speak from the ground, your words uttering out of the dust: your voice from the ground shall be like that of a medium; your sayings shall whisper out of the dust. (29:4) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover the multitude of her strangers will be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones will be as chaff that passes away; yea, it will be at an instant suddenly. (29:5) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff ;that passeth away: yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly. (29:5) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought low, you will speak from the ground; your speech will mumble out of the dust. Your voice will come ghostlike from the earth; out of the dust your speech will whisper. (29:4) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, in an instant, your crowds of evildoers (So 1QIsaa; LXX. MT of strangers.) shall become as fine dust, your violent mobs like flying chaff.  (29:5) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they will be visited of the Lord of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire. (29:6) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt be visited of the Lord of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire. (29:6) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But your many enemies will become like fine dust, the ruthless hordes like blown chaff. Suddenly, in an instant, (29:5) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shall be chastened by Jehovah of Hosts with thunderous quakings, resounding booms, tempestuous blasts and conflagrations of devouring flame. (29:6) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the nations that fight against Zion and that distress her, will be as a dream of a night vision; (29:7) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her munition, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision. (29:7) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD Almighty will come with thunder and earthquake and great noise, with windstorm and tempest and flames of a devouring fire. (29:6) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the nations amassed to fight against Ariel, all who congregate at her stronghold to distress her, shall be as a dream seen in the night: (29:7) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yea, it will be unto them even as unto a hungry man who dreams, and behold, he eats, but he awakens and his soul is empty; or like unto a thirsty man who dreams, and behold, he drinks, but he awakens, and behold, he is faint, and his soul has appetite. Yea, even so will the multitude of all the nations be that fight against mount Zion. (29:8) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion. (29:8) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hordes of all the nations that fight against Ariel, that attack her and her fortress and besiege her, will be as it is with a dream, with a vision in the night— (29:7) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a hungry man who dreams he eats but awakens famished, or like a thirsty man who dreams he drinks but wakes up faint and craving. So shall be all the nations that amass to fight against Mount Zion. (29:8) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, behold, all you that do iniquity, stay yourselves, and wonder; for you will cry out, and cry; yea, you will be drunken, but not with wine; you will stagger, but not with strong drink. (29:9) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink. (29:9) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as when a hungry man dreams that he is eating, but he awakens, and his hunger remains; as when a thirsty man dreams that he is drinking, but he awakens faint, with his thirst unquenched. So will it be with the hordes of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion. (29:8) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procrastinate, and become bewildered; preoccupy yourselves, until you cry for help. Be drunk, but not with wine; stagger, but not from strong drink. (29:9) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, behold, the Lord has poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep. For, behold, you have closed your eyes, and you have rejected the prophets, and your rulers; and the seers has he covered because of your iniquities. (29:10) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered. (29:10) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be stunned and amazed, blind yourselves and be sightless; be drunk, but not from wine, stagger, but not from beer. (29:9) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jehovah has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep: he has shut your eyes, the prophets; he has covered your heads, the seers. (29:10) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it will come to pass, that the Lord God will bring forth unto you the words of a book; and they will be the words of them which have slumbered. And behold, the book will be sealed; and in the book will be a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof. Wherefore because of the things which are sealed up, the things which are sealed will not be delivered in the day of the wickedness and abominations of the people. Wherefore, the book will be kept from them. But the book will be delivered unto a man, and he will deliver the words of the book, which are the words of those who have slumbered in the dust; and he will deliver these words unto another, but the words which are sealed he will not deliver, neither will he deliver the book. For the book will be sealed by the power of God, and the revelation which was sealed will be kept in the book until the own due time of the Lord, that they may come forth; for, behold, they reveal all things from the foundation of the world unto the end thereof. And the day comes, that the words of the book which were sealed will be read upon the housetops; and they will be read by the power of Christ; and all things will be revealed unto the children of men which ever have been among the children of men, and which ever will be, even unto the end of the earth. Wherefore, at that day when the book will be delivered unto the man of whom I have spoken, the book will be hid from the eyes of the world, that the eyes of none will behold it, save it be that three witnesses will behold it by the power of God, besides him to whom the book will be delivered; and they will testify to the truth of the book and the things therein. And there is none other which will view it, save it be a few according to the will of God, to bear testimony of his word unto the children of men; for the Lord God has said, that the words of the faithful should speak as it were from the dead. Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to bring forth the words of the book; and in the mouth of as many witnesses as seems him good will he establish his word; and woe be unto him that rejects the word of God. But, behold, it will come to pass, that the Lord God will say unto him to whom he will deliver the book, Take these words which are not sealed and deliver them to another, that he may show them unto the learned, saying, Read this. And the learned will say, Bring hither the book and I will read them; and now because of the glory of the world, and to get gain will they say this, and not for the glory of God. And the man will say, I cannot bring the book for it is sealed. Then will the learned say, I cannot read it. (29:11) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed:... (29:11) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LORD has brought over you a deep sleep: He has sealed your eyes (the prophets); he has covered your heads (the seers). (29:10) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For you the sum of vision has become as the words of a sealed book that they give to one who is learned, saying, Please read this, and he answers, I cannot; it is sealed.... (29:11) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore it will come to pass, that the Lord God will deliver again the book and the words thereof to him that is not learned; and the man that is not learned will say, I am not learned. Then will the Lord God say unto him, The learned will not read them, for they have rejected them, and I am able to do mine own work; wherefore you will read the words which I will give unto you. Touch not the things which are sealed, for I will bring them forth in mine own due time; for I will show unto the children of men that I am able to do mine own work. Wherefore, when you have read the words which I have commanded you and obtained the witnesses which I have promised unto you, then will you seal up the book again and hide it up unto me, that I may preserve the words which you have not read until I will see fit in mine own wisdom to reveal all things unto the children of men. For behold, I am God, and I am a God of miracles; and I will show unto the world that I am the same, yesterday, today, and forever; and I work not among the children of men, save it be according to their faith. (29:12) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned. (29:12) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For you this whole vision is nothing but words sealed in a scroll. And if you give the scroll to someone who can read, and say to him, “Read this, please,” he will answer, “I can’t; it is sealed.” (29:11) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... Or if they give it to one who is unlearned, saying, Please read this, he answers, I am unlearned. (29:12) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again it will come to pass, that the Lord will say unto him that will read the words that will be delivered him, Forasmuch as this people draw near unto me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their hearts far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precepts of men, (29:13) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men: (29:13) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or if you give the scroll to someone who cannot read, and say, “Read this, please,” he will answer, “I don’t know how to read.” (29:12) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my Lord says, Because these people approach me with the mouth and pay me homage with their lips, while their heart remains far from me— their piety toward me consisting of commandments of men learned by rote— (29:13) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people; yea, a marvelous work and a wonder; for the wisdom of their wise and learned will perish, and the understanding of their prudent will be hid. (29:14) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid. (29:14) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord says: “These people come near to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. Their worship of me is made up only of rules taught by men. (Hebrew; Septuagint They worship me in vain; / their teachings are but rules taught by men) (29:13) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore it is that I shall again astound these people with wonder upon wonder, rendering void the knowledge of their sages and the intelligence of their wise men insignificant. (29:14) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord. And their works are in the dark; and they say, Who sees us and who knows us? (29:15) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us? (29:15) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore once more I will astound these people with wonder upon wonder; the wisdom of the wise will perish, the intelligence of the intelligent will vanish.” (29:14) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Woe to those who contrive to hide their schemes from Jehovah! They work in the dark, thinking, Who will see us? Who will know? (29:15) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they also say, Surely, your turning of things upside down will be esteemed as the potter's clay. But behold, I will show unto them, says the Lord of hosts, that I know all their works. For, will the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or will the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding? (29:16) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding? (29:16) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe to those who go to great depths to hide their plans from the LORD, who do their work in darkness and think, “Who sees us? Who will know?” (29:15) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a contradiction you are! Shall the potter be regarded as the clay? Shall what is made say of its maker, He did not make me, or a work of its designer, He doesn’t understand? (29:16) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But behold, says the Lord of Hosts, I will show unto the children of men that it is not yet a very little while, and Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field; and the fruitful field will be esteemed as a forest. (29:17) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest? (29:17) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You turn things upside down, as if the potter were thought to be like the clay! Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, “He did not make me”? Can the pot say of the potter, “He knows nothing”? (29:16) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a very little while, shall not Lebanon again become a fruitful land, and lands now fruitful be considered backwoods? (29:17) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in that day will the deaf hear the words of the book; and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and out of darkness; (29:18) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness. (29:18) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a very short time, will not Lebanon be turned into a fertile field and the fertile field seem like a forest? (29:17) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book and the eyes of the blind see out of gross darkness. (29:18) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the meek also will increase, and their joy will be in the Lord; and the poor among men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. (29:19) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meek also shall increase their joy in the Lord, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. (29:19) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll, and out of gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see. (29:18) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lowly shall obtain an increase of joy in Jehovah, and the poorest of men rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. (29:19) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, assuredly as the Lord lives, they will see that the terrible one is brought to naught, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off, (29:20) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off: (29:20) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once more the humble will rejoice in the LORD ; the needy will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. (29:19) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For tyrants shall come to nought and scorners cease; all who persist in wickedness shall be cut off— (29:20) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they that make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproves in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of naught. (29:21) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought. (29:21) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruthless will vanish, the mockers will disappear, and all who have an eye for evil will be cut down— (29:20) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those who at a word adjudge a man to be guilty, who ensnare the defender at court, who for nothing turn away him who is in the right. (29:21) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, thus says the Lord who redeemed Abraham concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob will not now be ashamed, neither will his face now wax pale; (29:22) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore thus saith the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale. (29:22) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those who with a word make a man out to be guilty, who ensnare the defender in court and with false testimony deprive the innocent of justice. (29:21) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore thus says Jehovah, who redeemed Abraham, to the house of Jacob: No longer shall Jacob be dismayed; his face shall pale no more. (29:22) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they will sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and will fear the God of Israel. (29:23) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel. (29:23) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore this is what the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, says to the house of Jacob: “No longer will Jacob be ashamed; no longer will their faces grow pale. (29:22) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For when he sees among him his children, the work of my hands, hallowing my name, devoted to the Holy One of Jacob, reverencing the God of Israel, (29:23) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also that erred in spirit will come to understanding, and they that murmured will learn doctrine. (29:24) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine. (29:24) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they see among them their children, the work of my hands, they will keep my name holy; they will acknowledge the holiness of the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of the God of Israel. (29:23) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then will the erring in spirit gain understanding and they who murmured accept instruction. (29:24) -Gileadi



<a name='chapter_30'>**Chapter 30**</a> [(Top)](#top)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe, rebellious children, declares the LORD, who carry out a plan that is not mine, and who form an alliance, but is not of my spirit, so that they add sin to sin, (30:1) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe to the rebellious children, saith the Lord, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin: (30:1) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are wayward in spirit will gain understanding; those who complain will accept instruction.” (29:24) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe to you, rebellious sons, says Jehovah, for drawing up plans, but not by me, for making alliances without my approval, only adding sin to sin! (30:1) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who set out to go down to Egypt without asking for my counsel, to take refuge in the protection of Pharaoh and to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt. (30:2) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt! (30:2) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Woe to the obstinate children,” declares the LORD, “to those who carry out plans that are not mine, forming an alliance, but not by my Spirit, heaping sin upon sin; (30:1) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are bent on going down to Egypt— but have not inquired at my mouth— on seeking protection in Pharaoh’s forces, on taking shelter in Egypt’s shadow. (30:2) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the protection of Pharaoh will turn to shame for you, and the shelter in the shadow of Egypt to humiliation. (30:3) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion. (30:3) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who go down to Egypt without consulting me; who look for help to Pharaoh’s protection, to Egypt’s shade for refuge. (30:2) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Pharaoh’s protection shall turn to your shame, shelter in Egypt’s shadow to embarrassment. (30:3) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For though his officials are at Zoan and his messengers reach Hanes, (30:4) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes. (30:4) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Pharaoh’s protection will be to your shame, Egypt’s shade will bring you disgrace. (30:3) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all their officials at Zoan, and their envoys’ travels to Hanes, (30:4) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everyone comes to shame through a people that cannot profit them, (who) neither help nor profit, only shame and also disgrace. (30:5) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach. (30:5) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though they have officials in Zoan and their envoys have arrived in Hanes, (30:4) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they shall be utterly disgusted with a people who will avail them nothing; they shall be of no help or benefit, but a humiliation and disgrace. (30:5) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An oracle concerning the beasts of the Negev:In the land of trouble and anguish, from the lioness and the lion, the viper and the flying serpent; they carry their riches on the backs of asses, their treasures on the humps of camels to a people that cannot profit them. (30:6) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them. (30:6) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everyone will be put to shame because of a people useless to them, who bring neither help nor advantage, but only shame and disgrace.” (30:5) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An oracle concerning the Beasts of Negeb: Through a land of hardship and vicissitudes, of lions and the roaring (Hebrew mehem, of them, emended to nohem.) king of beasts, of vipers and the fiery flying serpent, they carry their wealth on the backs of young asses, their riches on the humps of camels, to a people who cannot profit them. (30:6) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Egypt, whose help is worthless and empty, therefore, I have called her Rahab, They Who Sit Still. (30:7) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still. (30:7) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An oracle concerning the animals of the Negev: Through a land of hardship and distress, of lions and lionesses, of adders and darting snakes, the envoys carry their riches on donkeys’ backs, their treasures on the humps of camels, to that unprofitable nation, (30:6) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egypt’s help shall be futile and vain; therefore I refer to her as an idle boast. (30:7) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it on a scroll, that it may be for a day to come, as an everlasting witness. (30:8) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever: (30:8) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Egypt, whose help is utterly useless. Therefore I call her Rahab the Do-Nothing. (30:7) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go now, write on tablets concerning them; record it in a book for the endtime, as a testimony forever. (30:8) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they are a rebellious people, lying children—children who will not hear the law of the LORD, (30:9) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the Lord: (30:9) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go now, write it on a tablet for them, inscribe it on a scroll, that for the days to come it may be an everlasting witness. (30:8) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are a rebellious people, sons who break faith, children unwilling to obey the law of Jehovah, (30:9) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who say to the seers, see not, and to those who have visions, do not have visions to tell us what is right. Speak smooth things to us, have visions of illusions. (30:10) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits: (30:10) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are rebellious people, deceitful children, children unwilling to listen to the LORD's instruction. (30:9) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who say to the seers, See not! and to those with visions, Predict not what is right for us: flatter us; foresee a farce! (30:10) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave the way, turn aside from the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease before us. (30:11) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us. (30:11) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say to the seers, “See no more visions!” and to the prophets, “Give us no more visions of what is right! Tell us pleasant things, prophesy illusions. (30:10) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get out of the way; move aside, off the path! Cease confronting us with the Holy One of Israel! (30:11) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, thus says the Holy One of Israel, Since you despise this word and trust in oppression and perverseness and rely on them, (30:12) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon: (30:12) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave this way, get off this path, and stop confronting us with the Holy One of Israel!” (30:11) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, thus says the Holy One of Israel: Because you have rejected this word, and rely on manipulation and double dealing, and on them are dependent, (30:12) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore, this iniquity will become to you like a break about to fall, a bulging out in a high wall, whose crash comes suddenly, in an instant. (30:13) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant. (30:13) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this is what the Holy One of Israel says: “Because you have rejected this message, relied on oppression and depended on deceit, (30:12) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this iniquity will be to you as a perilous breach exposed in a high wall which suddenly and unexpectedly collapses. (30:13) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he will break it, like a potter's vessel is broken, smashed without pity, so that a shard will not be found among its fragments with which to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of a storage pool. (30:14) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withal out of the pit. (30:14) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this sin will become for you like a high wall, cracked and bulging, that collapses suddenly, in an instant. (30:13) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall shatter with a crash like an earthenware vessel ruthlessly smashed, among whose fragments shall not be found a shard with which to scoop lit embers from a fireplace, or dip water from a tank. (30:14) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thus the LORD, the Holy One of Israel said:In returning and rest you will be saved; in quietness and in trust will be your strength. But you would not. (30:15) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thus saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not. (30:15) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will break in pieces like pottery, shattered so mercilessly that among its pieces not a fragment will be found for taking coals from a hearth or scooping water out of a cistern.” (30:14) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thus says my Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel: By a calm response triumph; with quiet confidence gain the victory. But you would have none of it. (30:15) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you said, No!But upon horses we will flee; therefore, you will flee. We will ride upon swift ones; Therefore, your pursuers will be swift. (30:16) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift. (30:16) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the Sovereign LORD, the Holy One of Israel, says: “In repentance and rest is your salvation, in quietness and trust is your strength, but you would have none of it. (30:15) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For you thought, Not so; we will flee on horses! Therefore shall you flee indeed. We will ride on swift mounts! Therefore shall your pursuers be swifter. (30:16) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thousand will flee at the threat of one; at the threat of five, you will flee, until you are left like a flagstaff on the top of a mountain, like an ensign on a hill. (30:17) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill. (30:17) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You said, ‘No, we will flee on horses.’ Therefore you will flee! You said, ‘We will ride off on swift horses.’ Therefore your pursuers will be swift! (30:16) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will flee by the thousand at the threat of one, by thousands at the threat of five, till you are left as a flagstaff on a mountaintop, an ensign on a hill. (30:17) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the LORD waits to be gracious to you; therefore, he will rise to show you compassion, for the LORD is a God of justice, blessed are all those who wait for him. (30:18) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therefore will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the Lord is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him. (30:18) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand will flee at the threat of one; at the threat of five you will all flee away, till you are left like a flagstaff on a mountaintop, like a banner on a hill.” (30:17) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then will Jehovah delay his coming, that he may favor you; out of mercy toward you he will remain aloof. For Jehovah is the God of justice; blessed are all who wait for him. (30:18) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, O people in Zion, who dwell at Jerusalem, surely you will not weep; surely, at the sound of your cry he will be gracious; surely, when he hears it he will answer you. (30:19) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee. (30:19) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the LORD longs to be gracious to you; he rises to show you compassion. For the LORD is a God of justice. Blessed are all who wait for him! (30:18) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O people of Zion, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, you shall have no cause to weep. He will graciously respond at the cry of your voice; he will answer you as soon as he hears it. (30:19) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the LORD give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet your Teacher will not hide himself anymore but your eyes will see your Teacher, (30:20) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers: (30:20) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O people of Zion, who live in Jerusalem, you will weep no more. How gracious he will be when you cry for help! As soon as he hears, he will answer you. (30:19) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though my Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet shall your Teacher remain hidden no longer, but your eyes shall see the Master. (30:20) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your ears will hear a word behind you saying:This is the way, walk in it, when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left. (30:21) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left. (30:21) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Lord gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, your teachers will be hidden no more; with your own eyes you will see them. (30:20) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your ears shall hear words from behind you saying, This is the way; walk in it! should you turn left or right. (30:21) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then will you regard your silver-covered graven images to be unclean, and your gold-plated molten images, you will cast them away as menstrual cloth, you will say to them, Go out! (30:22) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence. (30:22) -KJV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thus said Jehovah to me: As a lion or a young lion growls over the prey when the shepherds muster in full force against him, and is not dismayed at the sound of their voice nor daunted by their numbers, so shall Jehovah of Hosts be when he descends to wage war upon Mount Zion and upon its heights.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are worn out because of your many advisors. Let them stand up and save you, those who divide the heavens, who gaze at the stars, who announce at the new moons what is about to happen to you. (47:13) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee. (47:13) -KJV

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you are powerless, despite all your tactics. Now let those who unravel the heavens, who observe the stars and make predictions month by month, stand by you and save you! (47:13) -Gileadi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all they can do for you—these you have labored with, and merchandised with since your youth. They wander, each in his own direction. There is no one to save you. (47:15) -Parry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, even thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save thee. (47:15) -KJV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all they can do for you— these you have labored with and trafficked with since childhood. Each of them goes on in his error; there is not one that can save you. (47:15) -NIV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what your procurers (Or, merchants. Noun transposed; in the text it follows exerted yourself.  Compare verse :12.) have profited you— those for whom you have exerted yourself since your youth— each deviates his own way; none is there to save you. (47:15) -Gileadi
